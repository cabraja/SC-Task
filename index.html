                        Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Look me up when you get there, guess
                        I'll be about 47. Alright, we're the pinheads. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. I swiped
                        it from the old lady's liquor cabinet.

                        Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is
                        there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage
                        of them. I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to
                        come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. I've gotta go.

                        About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It
                        happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid.

                    What's that thing he's on? Without any sugar. Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to
                    act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it? Right. This is it. This is
                    the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday
                    night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next
                    Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future.
